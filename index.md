## Tracks

IACAP has a long-lasting tradition of promoting philosophical dialogue and interdisciplinary research on all aspects of computing. IACAP’s members have contributed to shaping the philosophical and ethical debate about computing, information technologies, and artificial intelligence. The 2026 annual meeting will continue this tradition and will gather philosophers, ethicists, roboticists, computer scientists, and engineers interested in topics such as:

* Computation, Cognitive Science, and Cognition  
* Computational Methods in the Sciences  
* Computer-Mediated Communication  
* Epistemological Issues in Artificial Intelligence and Computing  
* Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, Computation, Information, and Robotics  
* Human-Computational Systems Interaction  
* Information Culture and Society  
* Philosophy and History of Computing  
* Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence  
* Philosophy of Artificial Life and Biologically Inspired Computing  
* Philosophy of Information and Information Technology  
* Robotics and Embodiment  
* SIG: Mind and Machines  
* Societal and Environmental Impact of Computing Technologies and Automated Systems  
* Theoretical Problems in Computer Science  
* Virtual Reality

## Special Tracks

### Epistemology of ML

Machine learning technologies from deep neural networks to language models are being increasingly used in both formal and practical inquiry— e.g., science, policy-making, finance, etc.— in novel and important ways. Yet, their epistemic properties, roles, import and status are far from established. We invite papers that explore epistemological matters in ML technology.

### Ethics of AI

The recent rise in the use of multimodal data science technologies— often categorized under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence— in diverse socially consequential contexts (e.g., governance, medicine, etc.) has brought with it an abundance of ethical concerns across several domains deemed of moral relevance. While much has been written on the possible harms of AI technologies related to discrimination, privacy, governance and automation, an ethics of AI from a philosophical perspective can also offer a much more fundamental understanding of ethical concerns that go beyond just the accounting or the mitigating of harms. We invite papers that aim to expand on this latter, broader dimension of ethical concerns in AI.

### Pragmatics of LLMs

Recent advances in large language models, and the increasing institutional adoption of favoured services, create opportunities for philosophers to develop experience-based frameworks for professional practice and philosophical work. This track invites papers examining how philosophers develop norms and guidance for LLM use in research, professional, and collegial contexts, addressing questions of professional responsibility, pedagogical guidance, and the identification of problematic practices, informed by recent developments in LLM capabilities. 

## Workshop proposals

For a workshop proposal, please provide (a) a short abstract (approx. 200-300 words) describing the workshop in such a way as to be displayed in the conference program. Please add (b) a  long abstract (approx.) 1000 words that describes and justifies the  symposium topic in more detail. We also ask that you upload (c)  a set of short abstracts for each paper in the workshop.
