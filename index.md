# Joint IACAP/AISB Conference on Philosophy of Computing and AI (IACAP/AISB-25)

1-3 July 2025, University of Twente, NL

The [International Association for Computing and Philosophy](https://iacap.org) (IACAP) and the [Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour](https://aisb.org.uk/) (AISB) will host a joint conference from 1-3 July, 2025 at the University of Twente, NL. Submissions are now closed. The programme will be published soon.

On 30 June, 4TU.ethics will host a workshop on AI and neurotechnology at the University of Twente that will directly precede the conference. This workshop, organised in conjunction with member societies IACAP and AISB, also comprises the formal opening of the joint IACAP-AISB conference. The conference will include symposia, talks, posters, and panels on a range of topics from AI to computing. The 4TU.ethics workshop will give space to consider AI and neurotechnology ethics before an already exciting programme of events.

This highly interdisciplinary workshop is free and open to everyone, although priority will be given to members of 4TU.ethics and those who are registered to attend the conference. The workshop will be followed by a reception which doubles as a 4TU.ethics social event, allowing visitors the opportunity to meet up and (further) discuss ideas over drinks. The workshop is planned in association with this [special issue on NeuroAI](https://www.elspublishing.com/journals/law-ethics-technology/special_issues/ai-enabled-neurotechnologies).

## Call for Abstracts and Symposia Proposals (all closed)

The International Association for Computing and Philosophy (IACAP) has a long-lasting tradition of promoting philosophical dialogue and interdisciplinary research on all aspects of computing as it relates to philosophy. IACAP’s members have contributed to shaping the philosophical (both theoretical and applied) debate about computing, information technologies, and artificial intelligence. 

The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB) is the largest Artificial Intelligence Society in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1964, the society has an international membership from academia and industry, with a serious interest in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and related areas. It is a member of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence.

Our joint 2025 annual meeting will gather philosophers, ethicists, roboticists, and computer scientists and engineers interested topics that include:

* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Ethics, Philosophy, and Societal Impact of AI and Computing
* Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Human-Machine Interaction
* Cognitive Science and Computational Models of Mind and Behavior
* Embodied, Ecological, and Distributed Cognition
* Consciousness, Emotions, and Affective Computing
