## Call for Abstracts and Symposia Proposals 

The International Association for Computing and Philosophy (IACAP, https://www.iacap.org) has a long-lasting tradition of promoting philosophical dialogue and interdisciplinary research on all aspects of computing as it relates to philosophy. IACAP’s members have contributed to shaping the philosophical (both theoretical and applied) debate about computing, information technologies, and artificial intelligence. 

The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB) is the largest Artificial Intelligence Society in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1964, the society has an international membership from academia and industry, with a serious interest in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and related areas. It is a member of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence.[AISB info], and topic suggestions from AISB’s side.

Our joint 2025 annual meeting will gather philosophers, ethicists, roboticists, and computer scientists and engineers interested topics that include:

* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Ethics, Philosophy, and Societal Impact of AI and Computing
* Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Human-Machine Interaction
* Cognitive Science and Computational Models of Mind and Behavior
* Embodied, Ecological, and Distributed Cognition
* Consciousness, Emotions, and Affective Computing

We welcome submissions of various kinds: 

* [Symposia](https://pretalx.iacapconf.org/iacap-2025/cfp?submission_type=4821-symposium) – will typically run one or two full days. Successful applicants will issue their own CfPs and organise reviews
