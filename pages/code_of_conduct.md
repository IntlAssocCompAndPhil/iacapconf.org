## IACAP/AISB-25 Code of Conduct

IACAP and AISB are dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.   
   
**Harassment includes, but is not limited to:**  
 

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion  
* Sexual images in public spaces  
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following  
* Harassing photography or recording  
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events  
* Inappropriate physical contact  
* Unwelcome sexual attention  
* Unnecessarily aggressive and persistent interrogation of speakers  
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

   
**Enforcement:**  
 

* Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.  
* If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take action to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.  
* Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.  
* We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.

   
**Reporting:**  
 

* If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to have a positive experience at our event. That's why we're making every effort to ensure it's a success. It is people like you who make our event a better place, and we really appreciate your contributions.  
* By default, all reports whether they result in immediate action or not will be forwarded to the IACAP and AISB committees. They may be used in investigations of misconduct and for compiling statistics on incidents of harassment but will not be used for any other purpose. If you do not wish your report to be kept and used for this purpose please state this when giving the report.  
* You can make a report by either emailing the conference co-chairs: y.j.erden@utwente.nl or iacap@ballsun.com. Organisers can often be found at the registration desk.   
* When taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. We may need to involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once in a safe space, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.  
* Our team will be happy to help you contact university security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel comfortable for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.  
* This anti-harassment policy is based on the code of conduct from the [previous conference](http://aisb2018.csc.liv.ac.uk/code_of_conduct.html) and the example policy from the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment), created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
