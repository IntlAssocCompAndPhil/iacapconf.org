Conference Theme, "The Computational Turn: Past, Presents, Futures?" In 
the West, philosophical attention to computation and computational devices 
is at least as old as Leibniz. But since the early 1940s, electronic 
computers have evolved from a few machines filling several rooms to widely 
diffused - indeed, ubiquitous - devices, ranging from networked desktops, 
laptops, smartphones and "the internet of things." Along the way, initial 
philosophical attention - in particular, to the ethical and social 
implications of these devices (so Norbert Wiener, 1950) - became 
sufficiently broad and influential as to justify the phrase "the 
computational turn" by the 1980s. In part, the computational turn referred 
to the multiple ways in which the increasing availability and usability of 
computers allowed philosophers to explore a range of traditional 
philosophical interests - e.g., in logic, artificial intelligence, 
philosophical mathematics, ethics, political philosophy, epistemology, 
ontology, to name a few - in new ways, often shedding significant new 
light on traditional issues and arguments.  Simultaneously, computer 
scientists, mathematicians, and others whose work focused on computation 
and computational devices often found their work to evoke (if not force) 
reflection and debate precisely on the philosophical assumptions and 
potential implications of their research.  These two large streams of 
development - especially as calling for necessary interdisciplinary 
dialogues that crossed what were otherwise often hard disciplinary 
boundaries - inspired what became the first of the Computing and 
Philosophy (CAP) conferences in 1986 (devoted to Computer-Assisted 
Instruction in philosophy). Since 1986, CAP conferences have grown in 
scope and range, to include a bewildering array of intersections between 
computation and philosophy as explored across a global range of cultures 
and traditions. In keeping with what has now become a significant 
tradition, IACAP'11 will accept presentations across this array and range. 
At the same time, in order to recognize and celebrate the 25th anniversary 
of the CAP conferences, we specifically encourage submissions that include 
attention to the past, present(s), and possible future(s) of their foci as 
expressions of this computational turn.

SUBMISSIONS - due February 15, 2011

Authors should submit an electronic version of an extended abstract (total 
word count approximately 1000 words) to the chair of the track most 
closely affiliated with the proposed paper topic(s): see list of tracks 
and chair(s) below.  The file should also contain a 350 word abstract that 
will be used for the conference web site/booklet.

NB: if you are a PhD- or post-doc student who would like for your paper to 
be considered in the competition for the travel bursaries, be sure to 
indicate this in your submission.

PROGRAM

The conference is interdisciplinary: we invite papers from philosophy, 
computer science, robotics, engineering sciences, social sciences and 
related disciplines. Papers can address one (or more) of a range of topics 
at the conceptual crossroads between philosophy and computation, 
including: biocomputing, AI, logic, cognition, ontology, knowledge 
systems, simulations, robotics, affective computing, epistemology, 
information ethics (including robot ethics), history, and cultural 
perspectives on these. IACAP'11 will promote scholarly dialogues on all 
aspects of this computational & informational turn of society and the use 
of computers and robots in the service of philosophy.
