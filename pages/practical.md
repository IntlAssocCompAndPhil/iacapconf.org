## On-site information

- You will need to check in at the registration desk on arrival, and keep your conference badge visible at all times in order to access buildings and conference catering. 

- AV equipment is available in all rooms. Computers are installed only in the Ravelijn building (check the [schedule](/pages/schedule) for tracks assigned to rooms starting with "RA"). To be safe, please bring connectors if you prefert to use your own computer, as not all rooms are equipped with all types of AV connections.

- If your symposium or talk is hosted in DesignLab (check the [schedule](/pages/schedule) for tracks assigned to rooms "Learn-X" and "Inspire"), you will need to bring your own laptops (or share one), plus any connectors that might be required, e.g. to attach a Mac to an AV wire. There are no computers in those rooms. 

- For any practical questions or issues before or during the conference, please contact Saskia, Elize and Karin, who will also be at the registration desk each morning: [email contact](mailto:secretariat-philosophy-bms@utwente.nl).
 

## Location of the University of Twente Campus

The IACAP/AISB 2025 conference venue is situated on the campus of the University of Twente, between the cities of Hengelo and Enschede. The address of the UT campus is [Drienerlolaan 5, 7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands.](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Universiteit+Twente/@52.2396538,6.84979,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x47b813d9fcd767e3:0xd6c4861027d901e8!4m6!3m5!1s0x47b813d992e2ab01:0x790b33d6b663608f!8m2!3d52.2396538!4d6.84979!16zL20vMHBzN2g?entry=ttu)

The UT campus is easily accessible by train and bus. Visit/download the [9292](mailto:https://9292.nl/) app for local and national public transport or the [NS](mailto:https://www.ns.nl/) app (trains) for real-time public transport schedules and routes in the Netherlands.

Tickets for the train can be bought beforehand on the [website of the NS](https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/buying-your-ticket-online.html) or the [NS app](https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-app). You are also able to check in with your contactless debit card, credit card or mobile phone. Take a train to one of the train stations **Hengelo, Enschede or Enschede Kennispark** and follow the bus instructions below. On the bus you can pay with your credit/debit card or mobile phone and check out when you leave the bus. The travel will be charged depending on the distance.

- **From Hengelo** railway station take bus 9 to Enschede. Exit at _Kennispark_ or _Westerbegraafplaats/UT_ to enter our campus.
- **From Enschede** railway station take either bus 1 to Universiteit or 9 to Hengelo (buses pass the University). Get off at one of the line 1 stops on campus or for line 9, exit at _Kennispark_ or _Westerbegraafplaats/UT_ to enter our campus.
- **From Enschede Kennispark** railway station take bus 1 to Universiteit. Get off at one of the stops on the campus. There are several bus stops on the campus. You can find them on [the campus map](https://www.utwente.nl/download/campusmap.pdf). During peak hours, there are extra bus lines.

Like the rest of the Netherlands, the region of Twente has plenty of well-maintained bike lanes that take you across the cities, towns and countryside. Bikes are thus an easy and efficient way to get around and tour the area. The university is a 20 minute cycle ride from Enschede train station, and around the same from Hengelo station. Bike rental is also possible. You can find more details on the [UT page](https://www.utwente.nl/en/contact/route/#by-bike), or on [Visit Enschede](https://www.visit-enschede.com/bike-rental). Some hotels also offer bike rental, but bear in mind that they may have only a few available. We therefore recommend asking about these as soon as you book your room.

Online you can check [the campus map](https://www.utwente.nl/download/campusmap.pdf) for the University of Twente. Our campus is home to a dynamic community where more than 12,000 students and 3,700 staff members, representing a hundred nationalities, use the latest knowledge and technology for a better future.
