# 4TU.ethics workshop

On 30 June a 4TU.ethics workshop on AI and neurotechnology will be held at the University of Twente, NL. This workshop, organised in conjunction with member societies IACAP and AISB, also comprises the formal opening of the joint IACAP-AISB conference, which takes place at UT From 1 to 3 July 2025.
 
This highly interdisciplinary workshop is free for members of 4TU.ethics and those who are registered to attend the conference. The workshop is followed by a reception that doubles as a 4TU.ethics social event, but you should register for this separately if you intend to join. The workshop is planned in association with this special issue on NeuroAI.
