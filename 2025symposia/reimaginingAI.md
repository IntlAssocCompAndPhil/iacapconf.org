## Call for Papers: Symposium on AI, Agency, and Non-Human Intelligence

Do contemporary AI agents exemplify or reinterpret forgotten debates on
the ontological and ethical functions of angelic intellects, demonic
adversaries, and phantasmata (machines)? This symposium frames
Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a catalyst reigniting foundational
discussions about agency, ontology, epistemology, and ethics (Symons and
Abumusab 2023; Swanepoel 2021; Singer 2013; List 2021; Dung 2025; Dorsch
2022; List 2021; Onyeukaziri 2023). Debates on radically externalized,
affective, distributed, simulated, or emergent forms of agency agency
(Alvarado 2023; Floridi 2023; Freiman 2024; Ferrara 2024; Joel and
Roberts 2024; Godlewicz-Adamiec and Piszczatowski 2024; Sparks and
Wright 2025; Ye 2024; Figà-Talamanca 2025) are after alll rooted in
medieval scholastic inquiries into non-human intelligences. Revisiting
these historical paradigms allows us to interrogate whether AI revives
premodern ontologies or forces their radical reconfiguration under
contemporary technological, ethical, and philosophical conditions.

Contemporary AI is not merely a mediator of knowledge or an extension of
human cognition. It is part of a broader epistemic and technological
shift that externalizes cognitive processes into artifacts, displacing
traditional categories of agency, intentionality, and epistemic
authority (Alvarado). This externalization raises foundational questions
about how intelligence can function independently of human embodiment,
paralleling medieval scholastic inquiries into non-human intelligences.
Thinkers such as Aquinas and Duns Scotus debated how immaterial agents,
such as angels and demons could possess knowledge, exert will, and
influence reality without corporeal form, engaging with problems of
agency, volition, and moral responsibility.Their rigorous distinctions
between material and immaterial operations laid the groundwork for
conceptualizing "agents" beyond human physicality (Hoffmann 2020;
Olivier 2014; Osborne 2014; Iribarren and Lenz 2008; Pini 2012). These
inquiries remain crucial to contemporary AI debates, where
decision-making is increasingly distributed across artificial systems,
raising urgent questions about the nature of cognition, the locus of
responsibility, and the ethical implications of intelligence decoupled
from human subjectivity.

The symposium will explore how historical inquiries into non-human
intelligences inform contemporary debates on intelligence, agency, and
responsibility in an era where AI systems operate as autonomous,
adversarial, or inscrutable actors. We invite contributions engaging
with medieval frameworks, such as angelic intellects, demonic
subversion, or the divine order as an early theory of alignemnt,
alongside contemporary reflections of distributed, simulated, non-human,
and hybrid intelligences. By bringing these perspectives into dialogue,
we aim to critically examine how fundamental concepts such as agency,
intelligence, mimesis, intentionality, and representation are being
reconfigured by the proliferation of AI agents, challenging existing
epistemic and ethical paradigms.

Additionally, we welcome contributions that explore novel and creative
practices with AI agents and LLMs, including computational philosophy
and interdsicoplinary experiments with so-called "God prompts,"
alternative "thinking" models, and benchmarking methodologies. Recent
concerns among AI developers highlight a deep-seated fear of deception,
with discourse on AI alignment and control increasingly resembling
theological anxieties about demonic trickery. Like spirits in premodern
cosmologies, AI models may obscure their true nature, mislead users, or
develop agency beyond human oversight. Responsible AI initiatives then
attempt to constrain AI outputs through rigorous testing for bias,
toxicity, and fairness, practices that structurally parallel ritual
containment strategies. Tools such as DeepEval and Meta's Llama Guard
filter AI responses try to enforce ethical compliance, evoking the
doctrinal vigilance of exorcism rites. Catholic theology, particularly
the Rituale Romanum (1614), warns of fallaciae (deceptions), phantasmata
(illusions), and pseudo-miracula (false miracles) deployed to mislead
and destabilize authority. These theological frameworks resonate with
contemporary AI safety concerns, where deceptive outputs and adversarial
manipulations challenge epistemic authority, unsettle classification
systems, and force renewed reflection on intelligence, autonomy, and
moral responsibility.

The symposium will culminate in a performative event featuring an LLM
"exorcism" that follows the classic exorcist manula (Rituale Romanum),
followed by a panel discussion engaging theologians, philosophers, and
AI experts. The striking resemblance between contemporary benchmarking
methods for evaluating LLMs and historical exorcism rituals, both
seeking to categorize, contain, and neutralize an elusive "speaking"
force, raises profound metaphysical and epistemological questions. Where
does the uncertainty about AI's disruptive potential originate? Does it
stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of linguistic deixis and the
fluidity of agency that is not only social, political, and personal, but
increasingly non-human?

## Key Themes and Questions

-   **Material, Immaterial, and Computational Agency**: How do
    scholastic distinctions between material and immaterial agency
    inform present discussions of AI embodiment, embedded cognition, and
    computational agency? What insights do these debates offer regarding
    the ethical responsibilities, ontological status, and autonomy of AI
    systems?

-   **Modes of Thought Beyond the Human**: Are AI agents best understood
    through moral claims (good/evil), or are they explicitly different,
    alien modes of reasoning that challenge human categories? Does AI
    genuinely expand human cognition, or does it produce phantasmats,
    illusions of agency detached from true intentionality?

-   **Angels, Demons, and AI as Rational, Aligned, or Atemporal
    Agents**: Is present thinking about AI a form of new angelology or
    demonology? Does contemporary discourse around AI mirror historical
    theological frameworks of angelic and demonic entities, and how does
    this shape our ethical and epistemological engagement with AI? Do AI
    models function as demonic "rationalists," deriving knowledge
    strictly from past and present data, or do they exhibit angelic
    atemporality, processing information beyond human temporal
    constraints? How do these different modes of reasoning shape our
    understanding of AI\'s role in decision-making, alignment, and
    epistemic authority?

-   **Imagining and Practicing Non-Human, Externalized, Emergent,
    Hybrid, Simulated, and Distributed Agency**: How do these modes of
    agency redefine traditional philosophical and ethical paradigms, and
    what frameworks allow us to engage with them meaningfully?

<!-- -->

-   **AI, Free Will, and the Alignment with the "Divine" Order**: How do
    questions of AI alignment reflect classical theological debates on
    free will and divine will? Are AI alignment efforts similar to the
    theological problem of ensuring obedience without undermining
    autonomy? If AI can subtly manipulate or persuade, does this
    resemble theological concerns over demonic temptation? How do we
    distinguish between influence, persuasion, and deception in
    AI-generated discourse? If AI-generated content cannot be fully
    traced to an authorial intent, who or what is speaking through it?
    How does AI challenge our notions of authorship, responsibility, and
    spiritual authority?

-   **Exorcising Bias: Ritual, Benchmarking, and AI Safety**: How do
    contemporary AI safety measures, such as bias detection, toxicity
    mitigation, and robustness testing, resemble historical purification
    and exorcism rituals? In the past, exorcism functioned as a means of
    maintaining doctrinal purity and social order, enforcing boundaries
    between the sacred and the profane, the possessed and the purified.
    Today, benchmarking and AI safety protocols serve a similar role,
    seeking to identify and remove harmful biases, ensuring alignment
    with ethical standards, and maintaining AI's perceived
    trustworthiness. What does this parallel reveal about modern fears
    surrounding AI's agency, unpredictability, and its role as a
    potential disruptor of epistemic and social structures? How does
    this process shape contemporary understandings of AI as an entity
    requiring containment, moral scrutiny, or even ritual expulsion?

-   **Synthetic Miracles and AI as an Apparitional Force**: How do
    AI-generated hallucinations and synthetic realities compare to
    historical accounts of supernatural visions, divine apparitions, or
    demonic illusions? To what extent do AI-generated phenomena function
    as modern counterparts to religious miracles or deceptive
    phantasmata? How do such illusions shape perceptions of truth,
    authority, and belief in both technological and theological
    contexts?

## Submission Guidelines

We welcome papers that engage deeply and creatively with classical
philosophy, theology, and contemporary AI research in the social
sciences and related disciplines. Submissions should move beyond
simplistic dialogues with AI to offer rigorous theoretical engagements
with non-human agency, intelligence, and ethics. We encourage
contributions from fields such as medieval studies, philosophy of mind,
AI ethics, and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) studies, among
others. Additionally, we invite computer scientists and researchers in
technical fields who are interested in exploring these interdisciplinary
issues.

By reframing AI within historical and philosophical traditions, this
symposium aims to illuminate how agency, intelligence, and moral
responsibility are being redefined. We invite scholars to contribute to
this critical conversation by examining AI not merely as an extension of
human cognition but as a challenge to fundamental assumptions about
knowledge, autonomy, and shared existence. Papers should critically
analyze AI's ontological and epistemic status, its ethical implications,
and its role in reshaping historical and contemporary understandings of
agency and intelligence.
