## On Campus

Staying on campus during the IACAP 24 conference offers several advantages. Campus lodging is generally more affordable than nearby hotels, providing a budget-friendly option that also keeps you close to the conference activities. This proximity means less time commuting and more opportunities to engage with fellow attendees during social events and informal gatherings. Additionally, staying on campus fosters a sense of community, allowing for deeper networking and collaboration.
