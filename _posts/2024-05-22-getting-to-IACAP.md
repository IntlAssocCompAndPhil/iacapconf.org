## Directions

The IACAP 24 Conference will take place on the grounds of the University of Oregon, in Eugene, Oregon. Conference sessions will take place across several floors inside Tykeson Hall. 

Notably, Eugene has its own international airport, making travel easier compared to relying on the larger, but more distant, Portland International Airport. Eugene, Oregon, with a population of approximately 176,000, is a vibrant city known for its athletic culture and picturesque landscapes. If you like accessible hikes in the middle of a city, you will find many opportunities in nearby hills, parks and by the Willamette River, all of which are 10-15 minutes walking distance from the university campus. 

If you're arriving to the conference at Eugene Airport (EUG), you have several transportation options to reach the campus. The most convenient options to get from the airport to campus are taking a taxi (which are usually waiting outside of the airport) or using ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft, both of which offer direct and relatively quick trips to the university (~$30 + 10-20% tip). 

Some visitors choose to fly into Portland International Airport, the largest airport in the state of Oregon, and drive two hours south to Eugene.
