# Conference events

IACAP is happy to be able to host two socializing events during IACAP24
 
## Welcome drinks:

*Monday July the 8th 7:00 PM at [Max’s Tavern](https://www.maxseugene.com/)*
 
Max’s tavern is the oldest bar in Eugene and is only a 5-minute block from our conference venue. It is a relaxed local pub popular with both Eugene residents and college students. It is also famous because it is where Matt Groening, creator of the Simpsons, spent a lot of time writing his ideas. Max’s Tavern is supposed to have been a direct inspiration for Moe’s in the Simpsons. Side note: Springfield, Oregon, a town across the river (5-minute drive/30-minute walk), is supposed to be THE Springfield in the show, which would make Eugene Shelbyville (for those in the know). Springfield is full of Simpson’s murals.
 
## Conference Dinner

*Tuesday July the 9th 7:00 PM at [Agate Alley Bistro](https://agatealley.com/)*
 
Agate Alley Bistro is a delightful neighborhood restaurant. It is only a 10-minute walk from our conference venue. It serves quality regional and seasonal dishes in an unpretentious setting and atmosphere. Although we may have to work with a limited menu given the size of our group, vegetarian, pescatarian and meat options will be available.
